# Portfolio Website Design Document

## Project Overview

**Purpose**: Create a single-page portfolio website to showcase product management expertise and attract job opportunities.

**Timeline**: One week (urgent)

**Technology Stack**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Shadcn/ui, Framer Motion

## Architecture

### Single-Page Application with Smooth Scrolling

The portfolio implements a vertical scroll design with distinct sections. Each section triggers entrance animations when visible. Navigation provides smooth scrolling between sections with active state indicators.

### Core Sections

1. **Hero Section**: Full-screen introduction with animated text
2. **About & Skills**: Two-column layout with categorized PM skills
3. **Featured Projects**: Grid of project cards with modal expansion
4. **Experience Timeline**: Career progression with interactive milestones
5. **Contact**: Contact form and professional links

## Design System

### Visual Style
- **Colors**: Professional blues and grays with accent colors for CTAs
- **Typography**: Inter font family with clear hierarchy
- **Spacing**: Consistent margins using Shadcn design tokens

### Animation Strategy
- Scroll-triggered animations using Intersection Observer
- Staggered entrance animations for lists and grids
- Hover states with scale and color transitions
- Modal transitions with slide-up effects

## Technical Implementation

### Framework Setup
- Next.js 14 with App Router for performance
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
